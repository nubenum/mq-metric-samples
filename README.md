This fork adapts the Dockerfile so that it will build mg-metric-samples during Docker build:

`docker build -t mq-metric-samples .`

The connection user (i.e. UNIX user) used by the image can be set using `--build-arg MQ_USER=mqm` (this is the default). Then run directly inside a container mounting your config file, e.g.:

`docker run -v $(pwd)/mq_prometheus.sh:/go/bin/mq_prometheus.sh mq-metric-samples /bin/sh ./mq_prometheus.sh`

By the way, MQ V8 queue managers are also supported with a limited set of metrics (among others, queue depth), by setting the arg:

`-ibmmq.usePublications=false`

# mq-metric-samples

This repository contains a collection of IBM® MQ sample clients that utilize
the [IBM® MQ golang metric packages](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-golang)
to provide a program that can be used with existing monitoring technologies
such as Prometheus, AWS CloudWatch, etc.

## Health Warning

This package is provided as-is with no guarantees of support or updates.
There are also no guarantees of compatibility with any future versions of the package;
interfaces and functions are subject to change based on any feedback.

These programs use a specific version of the `mqmetric` and `ibmmq` golang packages.
Those packages are in the [mq-golang repository](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-golang)
and are also included in the `vendor` tree of this repository.

## Getting started

### Requirements

You will require the following programs:

* Go compiler. This should be at least version 10. If you see an error similar to "ld: NULL not defined"
then it is likely you need to upgrade your compiler.
* [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/) - Golang dependency management tool

To build the programs on Linux and MacOS, you must set an environment variable to permit some compile/link flags.
This is due to security controls in the compiler.

```
export CGO_LDFLAGS_ALLOW="-Wl,-rpath.*"
```

### Building a component

* Change directory to your go path. (`cd $GOPATH`)
* Use git to get a copy of this repository into a new directory in the workspace:

```
git clone https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-metric-samples.git src/github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-metric-samples
```

* Navigate to the mq-metric-samples root directory (`$GOPATH/src/github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-metric-samples`)
* Run `dep` to ensure that you have the correct dependencies downloaded:

```
dep ensure
```

* Compile the sample program you wish to use. See the README in each directory for more information.

At this point, you should have a compiled copy of the code in `$GOPATH/bin`. Each
monitor agent directory also has sample scripts, configuration files etc to help
with getting the agent running in your specific environment.

## Using a Docker container to build the programs
You can use the `buildMonitors.sh` script in this directory to build a Docker container that
in turn will build the binary programs and copy them to a local directory. That script also
sets some extra version-related flags that will be shown when the program starts.

## More information
Each of the sample monitor programs has its own README file describing the
capabilities in more detail. In general, the Prometheus monitor program is
likely to be the most recent, supporting the newest features of the MQ APIs.

## History

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) in this directory.
